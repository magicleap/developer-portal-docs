## General notes

- ML WebView API was extended to support two new features.
- API to pause and resume individual web view sessions.
- API to create webview with web inspector enabled or disabled at creation time.
- Application framework now provides a new API, KeepScreenOn(), for the applications to acquire a wake lock.
- Lifecycle sample updated to acquire the wake lock.
- A new WebXR launcher sample shows how to build a WebXR content launcher app. The application will start Magic Leap WebXR viewer and follows the appâ€™s life cycle.
- Mixed reality camera sample was updated to allow capture when the app is paused.
- Audio input sample was updated to allow capturing audio when the app is paused.
- Audio output sample was updated to demonstrate the usage of bypass of master volume.
