This section provides downloadable unity projects that walk through various features and provide template scenes for you to use in your own projects.

## Projects

- The [SDK Examples Project](/versioned_docs/version-1.1.0-dev2/guides/unity/sdk-example-scenes/sdk-example-scenes.md) provides demo scenes for many of the Magic Leap 2 features and use Unity's XR Interaction Toolkit as a simple foundation for UI and input. These scenes are great starting points for exploring and learning how to incorporate these features into your own projects.
