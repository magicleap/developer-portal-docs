## Overview

Action bindings map key, mouse, and gamepad input to actions that manipulate an object in the virtual room and generate corresponding events. For instance, if the object is a hand, you can use the left-arrow key to move the hand to the left, which generates events in the Application Simulator system that your application would see, through the MLHandTracking API, as a change in hand position toward the left.

Examples of the actions include:

- move-left/right
- rotate (pitch, yaw, roll)
- eye blink
- trigger-OK-gesture.

The objects, also known as targets, including these:

- Scene View camera (either free-fly camera or top-down camera)
- Head Pose (also known as Device View camera)
- Control
- Right Hand
- Left Hand
- Eye Gaze

Application Simulator defines a set of bindings for common actions, primarily movement and rotation, which manipulate one of the targets above. The target being manipulated is called the active target.

Here’s an illustration of default bindings for the Primary Navigation actions. Please refer to the default bindings tables at the end of this page for more.

![Diagram of Default Action Bindings](/img/app-sim/app-sim-action-bindings-figure.png)

If you want to use a gamepad as input, be sure to connect it to your computer. Application Simulator will remember bindings for the gamepad if it is disconnected.

## Action Focus Areas

In order for keyboard action bindings to work, one of the following three areas (called Action Focus Areas) in the Application Simulator window must have the input focus. Gamepad inputs will always work regardless of the focus area:

1. Scene View
2. Device View
3. Touchpad in Control Panel

![Action Focus Areas Diagram](/img/app-sim/focus_areas.png)

:::note
We suggest that you change focus to the Scene View or Device View using the secondary mouse button (usually the right button). The primary mouse button works too but it will likely change the selected object in the view, which may not be what you want.
:::

## Active Target Selection

When the Scene View, Device View, or Control's Touchpad area receives input focus, they automatically switch the active target to the Scene View Camera, Head Pose, or Control, respectively.

Another target can be selected as the active target using shortcut keys when an action focus area has the focus. Application Simulator provides default shortcut keys to change the active target:

|  Key | Select Target |
|:-- |:--- |
|5 |select and toggle between scene view camera and head pose |
|6 |select control |
|7 |select and toggle between left hand and right hand |
|8 |select eye gaze|

Another way to change the active target is to use the navigation target dropdown menu.

![Change the Activate Target from the Navigation Target Dropdown Menu](/img/app-sim/active-target-dropdown.png)

After you select the active target from the dropdown menu, in order to use keyboard inputs, you need to click on one of the action focus areas (see **Action Focus Area** section above).

:::note
Only the first choice of action focus area will preserve the active target. If you click on another area, the corresponding target (Scene View Camera or Head Pose or Control) will become the active target as usual.
:::

## Open Bindings

The **Action Bindings** window lets you view and change which input is mapped to which action.

Click the **Application Simulator** dropdown menu on the top left corner of the window. Click **Edit Action Bindings**.

![Location of the Application Simulator Action Bindings](/img/app-sim/edit-bindings-dropdown.png)

Then the Action Bindings window (namely the Action Binding Editor) appears, which shows current action bindings and lets you edit them.

![Application Simulator Action Bindings](/img/app-sim/action-bindings-editor.png)

## Action Levels

There are three levels of actions depending on their commonality.

1. **Level 1 Actions:** These actions are the common actions that apply to all types of targets. They act upon the active target. The Primary Navigation section in the editor window defines bindings for level 1 actions. Please see the following Primary Navigation section for more.

2. **Level 2 Actions:** These actions are common to one type of target, e.g. hand. Examples include actions for triggering a gesture of a hand in addition to those to move or rotate a hand. You need to select which hand, left or right, is the active target. The Current Camera, Current Hand, and Current Control sections in Action Bindings define bindings for level 2 actions. Note that the scene view camera and head pose (aka Device View camera) belong to the type of “camera”.

![Action Levels 1 & 2](/img/app-sim/action-levels-1-2.png)

For example, you can define key “L” to move the control left.

3. **Level 3 Actions:** These actions apply to one specific target, e.g. left hand, or scene view camera, regardless of the active target. All sections in the Scene View define bindings for level 3 actions.

![Action Level 3](/img/app-sim/action-levels-3.png)

For example, you can define key “M” to roll the left hand, or define key “K” to trigger the OK gesture of the right hand.

## General Section

![Action Bindings General Tab](/img/app-sim/action-bindings-general.png)

The General section in the Action Bindings window defines miscellaneous action bindings. For instance, it defines bindings for selecting the active target:

![Action Bindings General Tab Expanded](/img/app-sim/action-bindings-general-dropdown.png)

## Edit an Action Binding

Go to the action binding you want to change.

- To add a new binding, click + and use the Dialog Box.

![Add a New Action Binding](/img/app-sim/add-new-binding.png)

- Then you should see the following dialog:

![Add a New Action Binding Dialog Window](/img/app-sim/add-new-binding-dialog.png)

- To change an existing binding, double-click the existing binding.

![Edit an Existing Binding](/img/app-sim/edit-existing-binding.png)

Then you should see the following dialog:

![Editing an Existing Binding Dialog Window](/img/app-sim/edit-existing-binding-dialog.png)

### To Bind a Gamepad Stick

1. Click the mouse icon.
2. From the drop-down menu, select the mouse button or movement type you want to bind to this action. Any modifier keys can be selected from this menu as well.

To cancel changing an action binding, press Esc.

## Reset Bindings

Click **Reset** on the group menu to restore a group of action bindings to their default settings.

![Reset Action Bindings](/img/app-sim/reset-action-bindings.png)

To restore action bindings of a category to default, click this Reset button.

![Reset Action Bindings in a Category](/img/app-sim/reset-action-bindings-category.png)

To restore action bindings of a device (e.g. all of keyboard/mouse), select this:

![Reset Action Bindings of a Device](/img/app-sim/reset-action-bindings-device.png)

## Setting Deadzone and Sensitivity

The settings for sensitivity and deadzone can be changed for binding when applicable.

![Change the Sensitivity and Deadzone settings](/img/app-sim/sensitivity-deadzone.png)

:::note
The default settings for deadzone and sensitivity can be changed globally for a device from the main window under **Settings > Application Simulator > Peripherals**.
:::

## Saving Action Bindings

Currently, defined action bindings can be saved and loaded at a later time. Action bindings are saved as `.mlscheme` files.

![Save Your Current Action Bindings as a Preset](/img/app-sim/action-bindings-save.png)

The Save command is enabled if you have unsaved changes to the current set of action bindings.

## Context Menus

### Input Device Context Menu

![Input Device Context Menu](/img/app-sim/action-bindings-input-device-context.png)

- **Reset Bindings to Factory Default Reset**: Resets input binding for the device to factory defaults.
- **Clear All Bindings**: Deletes all input bindings for the device.
- **Filter to This Peripheral**: Displays actions bound to input from the device.
- **Find Binding for Input**: Lets the user discover which actions are bound to a given input. While active, the device selector will highlight and continuously scan the device for inputs. Trigger keyboard or mouse inputs (for the "Peripheral - Key/Mouse" device) or a connected controller (for other devices). The highlighted area will show the detected inputs and which actions are bound to it. Click "Stop Showing Inputs" to end the scan.

![Find Binding for Input Entity](/img/app-sim/find-binding-input.png)

Invoke any input from keyboard/mouse/gamepad, the entity will show which action is bound to it.

- **Apply Presets**: Allows you to apply a set of predefined bindings to the device. This is especially useful for a gamepad – e.g. with a Logitech gamepad connected, the command allows you to bind its input with common bindings of a Microsoft XBox 360 Pad.
