Application Simulator can now be used from within Unity as a native plugin without having to open ML Hub. This is enabled using the Magic Leap Application Simulator for Unity package. Note: this package still requires that both the ML Hub and Application Simulator Runtime are installed.

## Prerequisites

- Installed the [ML Hub](/versioned_docs/version-03-Jan-2023/guides/getting-started/install-the-tools.md).
- Installed [App Simulator](/versioned_docs/version-03-Jan-2023/guides/developer-tools/app-sim/app-sim-setup.md).
- [Configured Unity Settings](/versioned_docs/version-03-Jan-2023/guides/unity/getting-started/configure-unity-settings.md) for Magic Leap.
- [Configured Unity Settings](/versioned_docs/version-03-Jan-2023/guides/unity/app-simulator/configure-unity.md) for App Simulator.

1. Go to **Windows > Magic Leap App Simulator > App Sim Target**.

2. The **Target Selector** panel will now appear, which works the same way it does in the **ML Hub**'s Application Simulator. You can now select your target.

3. Click on the **Play** button, and start a new Application Simulator Session.

Once a new session has been started, you should now be able to use the Application Simulator from within the **Unity Editor** with the same workflow as if **Application Simulator** was started from the **ML Hub**.

:::note
Application Simulator in the **ML Hub** and **Unity** can run simultaneously, but this workflow is not recommended.

### Arranging the Workspace

From the same dropdown menu, you can open panels with other Application Simulator tabs, such as **Device View**, **Hand Tracking**, and more.

Those panels offer the same functionalities as other **Unity Editor** panels â€” they can be positioned, scaled, arranged, and docked to your workspace to suit your preferences.
