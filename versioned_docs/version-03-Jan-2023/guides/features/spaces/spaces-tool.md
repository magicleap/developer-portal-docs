Spaces is an application that comes preinstalled on the Magic Leap 2. It can be used to scan and localize into a local or shared spatial map.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

## Creating a Space

1. Launch the Spaces application from the Magic Leap 2 home screen.

2. Select **New Local Space** and follow the instructions on the screen. Note some objects do not map well, like ones that have dark or glossy surfaces.
