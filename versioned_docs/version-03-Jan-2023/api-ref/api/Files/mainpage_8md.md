# Magic Leap Native SDK (C-API)

The Magic Leap Native SDK exposes interfaces to our services and platform features so that you can integrate them with your 3D engine or application. This SDK is intended for use with the Magic Leap 2 hardware.

    * See [Native Development](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/category/native) for all the details on how to use the SDK.
