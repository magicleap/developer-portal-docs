- Display
  - You may see a color separated screen at power up and at power down for a few seconds. This will be addressed in a future update.
- 6DoF Control
  - On some power ups, you may not obtain 6dof control and not see the ray from the control. If this persists at powerup, please restart the device.
- Settings
  - Enable/Disable Wi-Fi from UI multiple times in quick fashion puts Wi-Fi into bad state. If that happens, reboot the device to fix the issue.
  - The Settings → General → Auto Time & Date, when enabled, retrieves and displays the current network time in GMT.  It does not automatically determine the time zone.  The automatically retrieved time/date will override any previous setting.
  - The date and time can be manually specified using the following adb commands:

```shell
adb shell date MMDDhhmmYYYY.00
```

Note:

- MM: is the month
- DD: is the day of the month
- hh: is the hour in 00-24
- mm: is the minute
- YYYY: is the year

```shell
adb shell am broadcast -a android.intent.action.TIME_SET
```
