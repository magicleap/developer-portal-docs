### OnDeviceError {#ondeviceerrordelegate-ondeviceerror}

Callback is invoked when the camera encountered errors. Invalid: The camera device is not available. Disabled: The camera device can't be opened due to a device policy. Device error: The camera device encountered a fatal error such as the Lightwear device has lost connection or the hardware comm bus is busy and not be able to response and caused a timeout. Service error: The camera service has encountered a fatal error and could not provide service. Capture failed: The capure request has failed. on&#95;capture&#95;failed or on&#95;capture&#95;buffer&#95;lost callbacks will be invoked when this error happens.
