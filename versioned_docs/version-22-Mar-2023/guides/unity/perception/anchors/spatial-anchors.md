This section will guide you on how to use Spatial Anchors, a shared reference point for tethering virtual content to a persistent physical location.

:::note
Magic Leap 1 used the term PCF (Persistent Coordinate Frame) to describe our previous system of anchoring virtual content. Differences between PCFs and Spatial Anchors can be found on the [Spatial Anchors Overview Page](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/unity/perception/anchors/spatial-anchors-overview.md)
:::

:::caution
This feature requires the `SPATIAL_ANCHORS` permission to be enabled in your project's Manifest Settings. (**Edit > Project Settings > Magic Leap > Manifest Settings**)
