Application Simulator can fit into your workflow in a few different ways. To decide which target mode you want to work in, first you want to decide where your input and world data come from. There are a few different sources this data can originate from.

## Iterate on the Device

One option is to use a physical device connected to your PC via a USB-C cable or WiFi, which allows you to execute the app on the device but debug your project on the host computer. To do this execute the following steps:

1. Connect a powered on device to your computer over USB.
2. Open the Target selector.
3. Select your device from the Target selector.
4. Click **Connect**.

When iterating on the device only, you cannot manually edit the headpose transform (among other settings) in the Interaction window properties. This is to prevent the digital content of your app from misaligning with the world and to prevent impossible real world scenarios that may break proper simulation.

## Iterate in Simulator Mode

The other option for using Application Simulator is to use the Simulator target. This will provide headpose and world reconstruction data from the virtual environment of the simulation. You can use this even if you do not have a device, making it ideal for large development teams with limited hardware. Additionally the Simulator proves an excellent testing environment by allowing simulation data to be saved and shared between developers or QA engineers.

1. Open the Target Selector.
2. Choose **Simulator** as **Target**.
3. Click **Connect**.

The Simulator populates with a default .room file automatically when it starts. Modify this behavior in the settings from the Application Simulator menu (Application Simulator →  Settings → Application Simulator → General → Default Session File).

When using the Simulator, the Headset is initially placed at `x:0.0 y:2.0 z:0.0`. The Controllers are placed somewhat forward and below that location, replicating typical hand positions. Modify this behavior in Settings from the Application Simulator menu (Application Simulator > Settings > Application Simulator > Simulator > Headpose > Starting Position).

You add to the virtual room layout by selecting the ![Add Room button](/img/app-sim/roomicon.png) Add Room button in the Scene Graph panel's toolbar.

If you want to completely replace the room, click the ![Clear Room button](/img/app-sim/clearroom.png) Clear Scene button, and then Add Room.

Virtual rooms are created in the Room Generator tool.

## Iterate Simultaneously on Device and Simulator

When both the device and Simulator are contributing data to Application Simulator, sensor data such as headpose updates or controller position updates from different sources are mixed together to provide fused sensor data to Application Simulator.

1. Open the Target Selector.
2. Select Simulator from the Target Selector.
3. Click connect
4. Connect a powered on device to your computer over USB.
5. Expand the Aux Devices drop-down list.
6. Add the connected device to the Simulator as a hybrid device.

## Stopping Application Simulator

To stop Application Simulator, toggle the **Target State Selector** to **Disconnected**.

## Running your App

To run your app in Application Simulator, configure your existing Magic Leap app or game engine project to build code that runs on the host instead of the device. 3D engines have some other settings you need to configure as well.

## C/C++ Apps and Custom Engines

### Overview

Application Simulator supports running programs on host which use the Magic Leap C SDK.  

As in ML1 development, standalone applications targeting the Magic Leap C SDK may be built and run under Application Simulator, merely by creating a host program which links against Magic Leap C SDK entry points. But as ML2 is built on Android (where standalone native graphical applications are not supported), this section assumes your goal is to start from an Android-style project which builds for device and adapt it for usage with the Application Simulator.

A key point is, Application Simulator only covers the C/C++ side of such projects; it does not support Java APIs. Thus, Android projects suitable for the Application Simulator should be native activities which invoke C/C++ logic in a shared library through the help of `native_app_glue` (see [Android's Native Activity documentation](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/concepts#naa) for more information).  

Application Simulator can load a host build of this native library and invoke its `android_main` entry point. But any callbacks to JNI code either need to be stubbed out or replaced with the Application Simulator C APIs.

:::note
The permissions system in ml_zi_permissions.h should be used to make permission requests under the Application Simulator instead of their JNI equivalents on device.
:::

## Application Simulator Environment Setup

The sections below assume the Application Simulator build environment which publishes an **MLSDK** environment variable (pointing to the Magic Leap C SDK) and a **ML_ZI _ROOT** environment variable (pointing to the Application Simulator Runtime).  Additionally, **PATH** and **DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH** (macOS) need to be established to run programs under the Application Simulator.

All of these steps may be performed by starting a command line prompt from the [ML Hub](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub/magic-leap-hub.md), which you can open by pressing F8 or by clicking the terminal icon on the bottom left. This terminal will be automatically configured for the Application Simulator development.  

Manual steps to set up a command line interface for the Application Simulator development are to run the following scripts:

```shell
source $USER/MagicLeap/mlsdk/<your-os-version>/envsetup.sh
source $USER/MagicLeap/tools/zi/<latest-app-sim-version>/mlvdsetup.sh
```

Additionally, building C-API samples requires setting up environment variables `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` and `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`. The user must have also built the Application Framework for host, and have set the environment variable `MAGICLEAP_APP_FRAMEWORK`. These steps are covered in the [C-API Command Line Workflow](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/native/getting-started/command-line-workflow.md) guide.

## Building C API Apps

:::tip
Reference the [**C-API Building Guide**](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/native/getting-started/command-line-workflow.md#building-the-sample-applications) for more building instructions to supplement the information below.
:::

An Android app is built for device using `gradlew`, which (for our purposes) can be split into "native build" and "Android build" parts. Application Simulator only requires the “native build” parts.  

Typically, Android projects contain an `app/build.gradle` file which contains an "externalNativeBuild { cmake { … } }" section that targets `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt`.  Application Simulator can share the cmake project used to build the native activity code, if the same is built as a shared library for host.

The C-API samples ship with a `build.py` script that automates the building of the shared library. The build process places the shared library, the manifest,  and the assets into sample specific folders within the `out/samples_host_samples` folder of the root `samples` directory.

All samples can be built for the host using `python3 build.py --build host` on the terminal. If you would like to build just one sample, use `python3 build.py --build host --project <project_name>`.

For eg., the shared library and the assets for the Controller sample can be found under `<path_to_samples>/out/sdk_host_samples/com.magicleap.capi.sample.controller`.

The launching of the shared library is covered in the next section.

## Launching C API Apps

The shared library built from the app's native source can be launched through a program, `ZILauncher`, that is distributed as part of the Application Simulator Runtime. As with Running the Application Simulator, the program can be launched from a Terminal (macOS, Linux) or Command Prompt (on Windows). The steps below assume such an environment.

- Set up the Application Simulator build environment.
- Launch `ZILauncher` by specifying the full path to the shared library from Building for Application Simulator.

```shell
ZILauncher /path/to/shared_lib
```

- The running Application Simulator instance in the ML Hub should report `ZILauncher` as connected. Then the app rendered frames should be visible in the Simulator's Device View or the headset if you are using the Device mode.

## Launching Standalone Executables

Users can also build standalone executables, for host, against Magic Leap C SDK APIs and Android headers distributed as part of zi_android_sdk in the Application Simulator Runtime folder. Those apps can be directly launched from the command line, i.e. without using `ZILauncher`.

## Troubleshooting

### Looking at the Event Log and Log Files

Application Simulator separates logging information into an Event Log and log files saved to your local drive. When Application Simulator is launched from Unity, the Unity log output goes to the Unity console, not the ML Hub logs.

You can view each of the logs by using the Application Simulator menu options.

![Show Logs Button in Application Simulator Menu](/img/app-sim/show_logs.png)

You can bundle all of the logs and runtime/error information by using the “Save Diagnostic Logs…” button. This is useful for reporting errors encountered when using Application Simulator. It will generate a .zip file that you can unpack to inspect before sending to Magic Leap Developer Support.

You can control the amount of verboseness in the log files by setting the log level to filter out messages that do not meet a minimum level of priority. The default log level is Info, which filters out all messages below the priority level of Info. Do not use the log level Debug unless trying to reproduce or report a bug, as that slows Application Simulator considerably.

To set the log level:

1. Expand the Application Simulator Activities menu, and then click Settings.
2. Select the Log Level.

You may use the following as a template for your message. Remember to attach the .zip of your log files as well:

- OS and Version:
- Graphics card or chipset:
- Details:
  - What were you doing when the problem occurred?
  - Which mode were you using: Simulator, Device, or Hybrid?
  - What 3D engine or development platform were you using?
  - Any additional details pertinent to the problem

### What data does this report file contain?

These log files include diagnostic information from the user interface, the Application Simulator server, and the Application Simulator app, and could potentially contain information that is either proprietary to you or that might identify you in some way. Examples of such information include and are not limited to:

- Your user name
- Path names on your local hard drive
- Any log messages from the ml_logging APIs
- List of installed packages and versions
- ML Hub frontend layout
- Java crash reports
- adb logs from default connected device
- Eclipse/ML Hub logs
- Application Simulator backend logs
- Unity editor logs

### Protect your privacy

Before sending or attaching the .zip file of the logs to report an error, open the .zip file and view the contents of the logs to make sure you are not sending any information you don't want public.
