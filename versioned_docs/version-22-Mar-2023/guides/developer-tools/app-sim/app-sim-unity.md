In order to play scenes against Application Simulator in the Unity editor, you must first install and configure Unity for Magic Leap 2. Follow the [Configure Unity Settings Guide](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/unity/getting-started/configure-unity-settings.md) for set-up instructions.

One your project is configured, you will need to configure your Unity Project to connect to the App Simulator correctly. See our [Unity App Simulator](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/unity/app-simulator/configure-unity.md) guide for more information on how to set up your project.

## Next Steps

You are also encouraged to try out the [**Unity Examples** project](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/unity/sdk-example-scenes/sdk-install-setup.md), found in the ML Hub's [package manager](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub/ml-hub-package-manager.md). The project contains several scenes demonstrating key Magic Leap 2 features. You can find which features are currently compatible with Application Simulator by referencing the [Application Simulator Key API](/versioned_docs/version-22-Mar-2023/guides/developer-tools/app-sim/app-sim-key-api-features.md) charts.
