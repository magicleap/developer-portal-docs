# Hardware Overview

This section provides an overview of Magic Leap 2 hardware specifications.

## Magic Leap 2 Core OS

Magic Leap 2 is built on top of the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/) (AOSP), Android 10 (Q) API level 29, which means:

- Command line interfacing to the device is managed by [adb](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).

- Applications for the device are built as standard APKs.

- Android Studio can now be used to develop for Magic Leap 2, including deployment and debugging.

## Hardware Specifications

### Controller

The Controller in Magic Leap 2 uses a combination of IR LED tracking and a lightweight SLAM tracker running on the IMU. Controller tracking should still work when there is no direct line of sight.

Because of the new tracking technology used, there are a few things you should pay attention to when building apps for the Magic Leap 2:

- The Controller can lose tracking if it is not in the line of sight and is in an area of low-light, low-texture, or high dynamic scenes. These conditions can break SLAM tracking.
- The Controller tracking will degrade in performance if it is out of line of sight for extended periods of time.

:::info
Magic Leap 2 now supports only one Controller at any given time.
