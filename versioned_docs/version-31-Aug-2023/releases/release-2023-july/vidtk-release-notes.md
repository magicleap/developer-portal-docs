This is the first release of Magic Leap Voice Intent Development Toolkit (VIDTK).

The VIDTK serves as an assistant for app developers to build application specific voice experiences. The local web service provides an intuitive user interface and aims to guide the voice intent developers from the creation of the very first voice intent to the creation of the asset (ML2 specific JSON scheme) that can be co-deployed with the desired application.

The following languages are currently supported:

- English (US)
- Japanese

Note: The initialization may require a few extra seconds of loading time on startup.
