:::note Latest Versions
Make sure to always use the latest version of the installed tools. As the used services are upgraded some APIs
might change and/or access policies be updated and it might not be possible to complete the process without having the
up-to-date CLI tools.

In case a problem occurs during the deployment of the infrastructure components or services, verify if the latest
version of the CLI tool was used and try again if an upgrade is available.
