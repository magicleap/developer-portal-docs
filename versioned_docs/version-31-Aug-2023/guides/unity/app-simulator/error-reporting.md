If you are experiencing issues with the Magic Leap App Simulator, let us know so we can help you get up and running. The App Simulator package makes it easy for users to save all of the diagnostics logs.

This section includes information on how to obtain diagnostics logs and share them in a Bug Report, also where to share those bug reports and feedback.

## Save Diagnostic Logs

1. Open the Magic Leap App Simulator.

2. Select the Save Diagnostic Logs Option.

## Report Issue

Please report bugs in the [Magic Leap Developer Forums](https://forum.magicleap.cloud/c/app-simulator/142).

The Save Diagnostic Logs… command in the Application Simulator Activities menu creates a .zip file of the available log files that you may attach to your bug report post.

You may use the following as a template for your forum message. Remember to attach the .zip of your log files as well:

```
