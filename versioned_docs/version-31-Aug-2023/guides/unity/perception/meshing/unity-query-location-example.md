This section includes an example on how to change the bounds and origin of mesh queries that are generated by the [`UnityEngine.XR.MagicLeap.MeshingSubsystemComponent`](/versioned_docs/version-31-Aug-2023/guides/unity/perception/meshing/unity-meshing-subsystem-component.md). This feature is useful to limit the amount of meshes generated at runtime to reduce performance overhead meshes

:::caution

Before proceeding make sure you have an object with a properly configured `MeshingSubsystemComponent` attached. In addition to having the `WORLD_RECONSTRUCTION` permission to be enabled in your project's Manifest Settings. (**Edit > Project Settings > Magic Leap > Manifest Settings**)

:::

## Example

This example adjusts the location of the mesh queries to originate from the Main Camera and the size of it's bounds.

```csharp showLineNumbers
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.MagicLeap;

public class MeshQueryLocationExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField, Tooltip("The spatial mapper from which to update mesh params.")]
    private MeshingSubsystemComponent _meshingSubsystemComponent = null;
    [SerializeField, Tooltip("The Bounds to query for meshes in meters.")]
    private Vector3 _bounds = new Vector3(5,5,5);

    void Update()
    {
        _meshingSubsystemComponent.gameObject.transform.position = Camera.main.gameObject.transform.position;
        _meshingSubsystemComponent.gameObject.transform.localScale = _bounds;
    }

}

```
