## Overview

Magic Leap's Gesture Classification API allows developers create interactions based on a user's hand pose. It provides access to calculate specific `KeyPoses` and more inclusive `Postures`. The API can also be used to query finger specific data such as : a finger's length and if the finger is fully extended or not.

|Supported Key Poses | Supported Postures|
|--------------------|-------------------|
|OK , C , Pinch , Finger , L , Thumb , Fist , Open | Pinch , Point , Grasp , Open|
