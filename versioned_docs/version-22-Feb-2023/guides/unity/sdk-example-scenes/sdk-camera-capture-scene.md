## Overview

This example demonstrates the functionality of using the camera capturing in one the 3 modes:

- CamOnly
- VirtualOnly
- MR

Use `Camera Flag` to connect with the desired Camera mode

Use the `StreamCapabilities` dropdown to select the desired stream to be captured.

The data received from the camera is processed with a posterization algorithm and then rendered to a texture for example purposes. Intrinsic properties of the camera are shown on the side when recording starts.
