### Safety

High opacities of Global and Segmented Dimming can create hazards to users by lowering visibility in their environments. Thus, it’s important to be aware of your user’s environment and consider what content truly needs to be high opacity and how you can maximize the visibility of both the real and virtual worlds. For example, choosing to globally dim more than 50% of the user’s environment may be limiting the experience if the user needs to see the real world while using the application.

You can set a maximum value for both Global and Segmented Dimming for your application,  but consider that a user can always choose to override this permission and set their own maximum values that they’ve configured in Settings.
