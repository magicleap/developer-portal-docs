## Lumin SDK notes

1. This is a very early version and it may have some lingering references to ML1 that are still not removed. We are in the process of cleaning things up.

2. The package includes a comprehensive set of headers files, at this time only the following headers have been cleared for ML2:
    - ml_graphics.h
    - ml_perception.h
    - ml_head_tracking.h
    - ml_input.h
    - ml_controller.h
    - ml_camera_v2.h
