This section provides instructions on creating a new Unity with a version that is compatible with Magic Leap 2 development.

## Prerequisites

- Installed [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

## Creating a New Project

Create a new project using the Universal Render Pipeline template. Although Magic Leap 2 supports both URP & the Built-in render pipeline, it is recommended to use URP since the built-in pipeline is slowly being deprecated by Unity.

1. Open the Unity Hub.
2. Select **New project**.
3. Set the **Editor Version** to one that is compatible with the Magic Leap 2 (in the range of **2022.2.x**).
4. Select the **3D (URP)** (3D Universal Render Pipeline) template project, then **Create project**.
