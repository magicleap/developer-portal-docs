```cpp
float fill_hole_length;
```


Any hole which has perimeter (in meters) less than fill_hole_length will be filled. The maximum hole perimeter is limited to 5 meters. Also The maximum area of the hole should not exceed 0.5 square meters. If the hole overlaps with neighboring mesh block/s, it won't be filled in.
