This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to enable Developer Mode on Magic Leap 2. The process involves unlocking the hidden Developer Options by tapping the "Build number" seven times. The newly enabled Developer Mode offers a range of advanced settings and tools that are typically hidden from average users, mainly used for debugging and application development purposes.

1. Open the **Settings** app.

3. Find the section titled **Build number** on the bottom of the page.

4. Click on **Build number** seven times.
   1. After a few clicks, you will see a countdown message saying, "You are 'X' steps away from becoming a developer," with 'X' representing the number of remaining clicks
   2. After the seventh tap, you'll see a message saying, "You are now a developer!" or "Developer mode has been enabled"
