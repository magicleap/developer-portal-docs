You can develop for Magic Leap using the Native C API or Unity. If you need help finding the right tool, this article provides additional details on each development path.

## Unity

Unity is a leading platform for real-time development. The underlying runtime code is written in C++, and all scripting is done using C#. Unity supports all types of projects, including movies, games, and animation cinematics. It also allows you to render engineering or architectural concepts in a virtual environment.

## Native

Our C API allows developers to create Magic Leap 2 applications using C++. It also allows developers to extend Magic Leap features for Unity via plugins. At this time the C API offers access to more features than the Unity SDK.
