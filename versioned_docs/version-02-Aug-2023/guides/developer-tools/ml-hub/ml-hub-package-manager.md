Package Manager is a tool to install and manage ML SDK, tools, and resources for development platforms that support Magic Leap 2.

Open **Package Manager** from the home screen of the Magic Leap Hub.

Navigate between **Bundles**, **All**, and **My Tools** to select packages to install or update.

- **Bundles** - Select collections of packages that include the tools and resources you need to develop for the Magic Leap ecosystem quickly. Bundled packages install the latest version available. When a bundle is selected, you can view which packages are included in the bundle in the **Change Summary** panel. Optional packages, such as API documentation, are not selected by default.

Once you have selected a bundle or individual package, the **Change Summary** panel displays.

<Image url= {require("/img/ml-hub/ml_hub_change_summary.png")} >lab-package-manager-change-summary</Image>

This lists the required packages for selected bundles, the version number, actions to be performed, and any optional packages. Select the optional packages to install or update them.

After you've made your selections in the **Change Summary** panel, click **Apply Changes** to install or update the packages.

When you're done installing or updating packages, close Package Manager from the Activities Menu. You can also close Package Manager from the Summary page after installation is complete.
