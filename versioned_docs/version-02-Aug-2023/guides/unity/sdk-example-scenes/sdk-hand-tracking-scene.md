## Overview

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using **Hand Tracking**.

The images above the main UI depict all the recognized hand key poses. As you perform these key poses, the example highlights the images of the poses that are detected and prints both the name of the key pose and the confidence percentage. The confidence percentage specifies how confident we are that the key pose you are performing is the key pose that is detected.

The image mapped to the hand key pose being performed will rotate to match the specific hand performing the key pose.

When both hands perform the same key pose, the image will spin.

In addition to this, as you examine your hands, you will see various key points.
