#  Global/Segmented Dimmer

Magic Leap devices have additive displays, which take the light within a user’s environment and add photon to the display, making it possible to render content. The Magic Leap 2 introduces a new low resolution panel which selectively *subtracts* photons in the environment by using two types of dimming: **Global Dimming** and **Segmented Dimming**.

## What is Global Dimming?

**Global Dimming** is a *tint* applied over the entire display, behind your content. It sets a single opacity value that dims the real-world environment. Global Dimming is an exchange between two valuable resources: the visibility of the user’s environment, and the device’s *content opacity* (including image quality).

For example, if a user is in a bright room watching content, the application may request Global Dimming be set to a high (dark) value.

If the user is in a poorly lit room, talking with a coworker, the application may prioritize being able to see the coworker well and set Global Dimming to the minimum value.

## What is Segmented Dimming?

Unlike Global Dimming, **Segmented Dimming** utilizes the dimmer panel to allow **specific portions** of content to be dimmed—making virtual content appear more opaque without needing to tint the entire display.
