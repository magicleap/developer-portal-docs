Spaces is an application that comes preinstalled on the Magic Leap 2. It can be used to scan and localize into a local or shared spatial map.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

## AR Cloud Licenses

The Spaces tool can be used on any version/license of a Magic Leap 2. For more info about adding extra features with AR Cloud, see the following page about licenses:

## Creating a Space

1. Launch the Spaces application from the Magic Leap 2 home screen.

<Image url= {require("/img/device/spaces/spaces_1.png")} >Spaces selected on the home screen</Image>

2. Select **New Local Space** and follow the instructions on the screen. Note some objects do not map well, like ones that have dark or glossy surfaces.

<Image url= {require("/img/device/spaces/spaces_2.png")} >The default view inside the Spaces Application</Image>

<Image url= {require("/img/device/spaces/spaces_3.png")} >Prompts to scan your space</Image>

3. When you are finished scanning your space, select **Finish Scanning** then, select **Yes, Save**.

4. Your new space should now appear in your list of spaces.

For more specific in-device guidance on the scanning process, click the information icon on the bottom left corner of the Spaces home menu screen.
