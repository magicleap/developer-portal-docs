AR Cloud requires an active license to be activated on a device. Licenses are chosen at the time of purchase of a Magic Leap 2 device.

## Choosing a License

<Licenses />

### Disambiguation

The primary entrypoint to any spatially-mapped experience on a Magic Leap 2 is our [Spaces](/versioned_docs/version-02-Aug-2023/guides/features/spaces/spaces-tool) tool. The Base model of ML2 can still use [Spatial Anchors](/versioned_docs/version-02-Aug-2023/guides/features/spaces/spatial-anchors), albeit in an offline manner, where Spatial Maps are stored on-device.

*AR Cloud-ready refers to features described in the [Benefits section of our AR Cloud Overview page](/versioned_docs/version-02-Aug-2023/guides/arcloud#benefits). Developer Pro or the Enterprise Editions are required to get these added feature sets.
