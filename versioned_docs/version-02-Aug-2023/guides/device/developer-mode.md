# Developer Mode

In order to update the OS, view custom spatial anchors in the Spaces application, and build and deploy your own applications to the Magic Leap 2 headset, you must enable Developer Mode inside the Settings application.

## How to enable Developer Mode

1. Inside the headset, open the **Settings** application.

<Image url= {require("/img/developer-mode/settings.png")} >Setting app in the OS menu</Image>

2. Go to **About**

<Image url= {require("/img/developer-mode/settings-about.png")} >About section in Settings</Image>

3. Scroll down to find the **Build Number**

<Image url= {require("/img/developer-mode/build-number.png")} >Build Number section in About</Image>

4. Hover over the Build Number and squeeze the trigger 7 times. You will get a confirmation message that the device is now in Developer Mode.
