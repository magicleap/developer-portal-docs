- SettingsIntentsLauncher can be used to open certain Android Settings views directly from Unity.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug in WebRTC where toggling local video off and then back on during a connected session did not work.
- Fixed bug in WebRTC which prevented a session from persisting between scene changes.
- Fixed bug in WebRTC where Mixed Reality capture showed a transparent vertical bar on the side of the image.
- Fixed MLSegmentedDimmer behavior where disabling dimmers using the IsEnabled property did not work as expected. The property has been marked Obsolete and replaced with a SetEnabled() method which turns on and off the MeshRenderers for objects on your Segmented Dimmer layer.
- Fixed issue with WebView's first tab loading before service is connected.
- Fixed Meshing Subsystem using invalid handles if device headpose gets reset.
- Corrected some MLCamera event delegates being incorrectly defined.
- Fixed issue in WebView where adding too many tabs caused them to begin rendering outside of UI bounds.
- MagicLEapHandDevice is no longer derived from XRController.

## Deprecations & Removals

- Numerous MLSegmentedDimmer API properties have been marked Obsolete as they are non-functional and will be removed in a future release.

## Known Issues

- Marker Tracker's marker rotations upside down.
- Headset reports position at 0,0,0 on Start().
- Wacom touch ring appears to not be working.
