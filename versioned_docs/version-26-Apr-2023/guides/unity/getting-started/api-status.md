## Migration Tips

### Universal Render Pipeline

Although Unity's built-in render pipeline currently works on this engine, it is not planned to be officially supported on Magic Leap 2. Therefore, if you plan to port any of your existing projects to Magic Leap 2, we recommend that you start early by porting to URP. URP does work on the Magic Leap 1, so testing should be easy. You can use the following links as reference:

### Vulkan Rendering

Unity on Magic Leap 2 only supports Vulkan rendering. If you are using any GLSL shaders in your project or are using any native rendering plugins that don't support Vulkan, you will need to configure them to support the Vulkan renderer.
