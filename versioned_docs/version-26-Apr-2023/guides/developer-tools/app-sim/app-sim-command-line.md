There is currently an issue with some Macs not being able to open the ML Hub terminal. To get around this bug, you can open up any command line interface (e.g. Terminal) and set up your environment with the following commands:

```shell
source $USER/MagicLeap/mlsdk/<your-os-version>/envsetup.sh
source $USER/MagicLeap/tools/zi/<latest-app-sim-version>/mlvdsetup.sh
```
