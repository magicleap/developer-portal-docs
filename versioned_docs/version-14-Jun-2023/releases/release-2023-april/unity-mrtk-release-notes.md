## 1.6.0 Version 1 Updates

- Updated to MagicLeap SDK 1.2.0 and MagicLeap Unity SDK 1.6.0.
- Fixed false Permission Denied Log for Meshing.
- Exposed the values to determine if the controller is being held in hand. These settings only appear in the Magic Leap Device Manager 
- Input Data Provider if the *Disable Controller When Not in Hand* option is selected.
- Examples with HandTracking, Meshing, and Controller now print settings on the UI panel to show which settings have been selected for the scene.

## Known Issues

- Handtracking Performance issues when interacting with other objects. Continuous Improvements made each Sprint.
- To use the simulator when running MRTK, you must set the Script Changes While Playing setting to Stop Playing and Recompile or Recompile and Continue Playing in the Unity Preferences.
- The Slot Example in the Speech Commands Sample scene will trigger the change color MRTK popup.
- Occasionally the controller may not connect properly when launching a new application. Pausing and resuming the application resolves this.

## Important Notes

- Instead of copying a configuration file, clone the DefaultMixedReality version and make adjustments. We have found copying an MRTK configuration file can cause issues such as Input Data Providers not loading or visualizers not attaching properly.
- Controller Visualizer sometimes stops positioning and the logs say: Left_ControllerModel(Clone) is missing a IMixedRealityControllerVisualizer component! This happens sporatically, we have found adding the MixedRealityControllerVisualizer component to the model itself resolves this.
- If your application builds and results in a blank/empty scene, you must adjust your projects quality settings. (Known issue in editors 2021.1 and older) To resolve this, remove all but one of the quality presets in your projects quality settings (Edit>Player Settings>Quality).
- Users may need to add the tracked pose driver to the camera themselves.
