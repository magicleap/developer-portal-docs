## Overview

There are two main ways of building Native applications, a [command line workflow](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/native/getting-started/command-line-workflow.md) and an [Android Studio workflow](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/native/getting-started/android-studio-workflow.md). Use whichever you prefer, however both require the following prerequisite downloads.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the latest version of the [Vulkan SDK](https://www.lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/).

2. Install the latest *Electric Eel* version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/archive). (2022.1.1 Patch 2 at time of writing)

:::note
Make sure you have installed the Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Command Line, and Android SDK Platform Tools in Android Studio if they did not automatically download.

3. Open the SDK Manager

You can find the SDK Manager by either selecting **More Actions** on the landing screen, or from the **Tools** dropdown from within a project.

:::note
You may need to install Ninja if you are getting errors that CMake can't find it:

```shell
"CMake Error: CMake was unable to find a build program corresponding to "Ninja"."
```

Please see [here](https://ninja-build.org) for details on how to install Ninja.
