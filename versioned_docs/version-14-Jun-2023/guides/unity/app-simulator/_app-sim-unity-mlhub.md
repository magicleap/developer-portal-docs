If you do not wish to install the Application Simulator for Unity Package or if you need greater graphics support, you can run the App Simulator directly from the Magic Leap Hub.

:::info Graphics API
Running the Application Simulator from the Magic Leap Hub allows developers to use more graphics APIs when connecting to the App Simulator.

1. Open the Player Settings Window (**Edit > Project Settings > Player**) section, then select the Standalone tab.
2. Expand the **Other Settings** and under **Rendering**, uncheck or adjust the Graphics API for your platform to [one that is compatible with your configuration](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/developer-tools/app-sim/app-sim-graphics-compatibility.md#using-application-simulator-interface-in-ml-hub-along-with-unity).
