# Web View Overview

This section includes information about implementing a Web View inside your Unity Application. A Web View allows developers to display web pages directly inside their application and interact with it, similar to an iframe inside a webpage.

:::caution
This feature requires that both `WEBVIEW` permissions are enabled in your project's Manifest Settings. (**Edit > Project Settings > Magic Leap > Manifest Settings**) and that `Internet Access` is set to **Required** in your project's settings. (**Edit > Project Settings > Player > Android Platform (Android Icon) > Other Settings > Configuration (subsection)**)
