This section assumes you created a new project using the URP template. The URP template project includes a collection of various URP assets, each pre-configured with different settings to represent different levels of quality. However, for Android apps running on our platform, the default configuration does not allow for a smooth 60 FPS experience in even the simplest scene. Follow these steps to configure the URP settings in your project to improve performance.

:::info
While using the Universal Render Pipeline is not required, it is strongly recommended because some features, such as Segmented Dimming, will not work properly when using Unity's legacy renderer
:::

## Prerequisites

- [Unity project using Editor in the range of **2022.2.x**](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/unity/getting-started/create-a-project.md)
- [Configure Unity Settings](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/unity/getting-started\configure-unity-settings.md)

## Delete the starter URP assets

To begin, simplify your project by removing the **Pipeline** and **Renderer** assets provided by the template. To do this, select the existing Render Pipeline assets, right-click, and choose **Delete**.

## Create a new pair of URP assets

From the Unity menu, select **Assets > Create > Rendering > URP Asset (With Universal Renderer)**

## Configure Render Pipeline asset

Select the **Pipeline** asset you just created and tweak the Rendering, Quality, Lighting, and Shadows settings, removing or reducing things unnecessary for the look and feel of your project.

## Set the default Scriptable Pipeline

Open your Project's Graphics settings (**Edit > Project Settings** then select **Graphics**), and set the **Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings** to the URP pipeline asset you created in the previous step.
