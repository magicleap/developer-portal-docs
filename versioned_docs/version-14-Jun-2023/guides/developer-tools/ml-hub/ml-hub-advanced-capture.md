The Advanced Capture module in [Magic Leap Hub](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub/magic-leap-hub) enables developers to have greater control over the quality and look of the photos and videos of mixed reality content captured on device.

## Using Advanced Capture

To begin an advanced capture session:

1. Connect the headset to the computer and power it on.
2. Check that the headset is detected by your machine by either opening [Device Bridge](/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/versioned_docs/version-14-Jun-2023/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub/ml-hub-device-bridge)inside Magic Leap Hub or executing `adb devices` in the terminal.
3. Start the Advanced Capture module from the Magic Leap Hub home menu.

## Capture Preview

Once your device is connected, you can capture a preview snapshot of the view from the device by clicking the refresh icon in the upper left corner of the preview window.

<Image url= {require("/img/ml-hub/advanced-capture/home_no_preview.jpg")} >Advanced Capture window no preview</Image>

The resulting still displays the quality of the image with its current settings, which can be adjusted using the settings UI on the left side of the Advanced Capture window.

- **Tint** controls the warm or cool tone quality of the image
- **White Balance** is comparable to white balance settings on most digital cameras, the available white balance settings are Auto White Balance, Daylight, Cloudy, Twilight, Shade, Incandescent, Flourescent and Off.
