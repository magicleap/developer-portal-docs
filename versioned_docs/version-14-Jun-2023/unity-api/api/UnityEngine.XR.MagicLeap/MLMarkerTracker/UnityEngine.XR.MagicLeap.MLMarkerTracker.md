ArUco dictionaries can be looked up and markers can be generated for them here: [http://chev.me/arucogen/](http://chev.me/arucogen/) Note: Due to 4X4 dictionaries suffering from frequent false detections, we discourage their use.

-----------

### CameraHint {#enums-camerahint}

The CameraHint enum values are used to hint to the camera that should be used. This is set in the MLMarkerTracker.CustomProfile structure and this setting currently only applies to the aruco detectors. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| RGB | | Single RGB Camera.   |
| World | | One or more world cameras.   |




**Details**

RGB camera has higher resolution than world cameras and are better suited for use cases where the target to be tracked is small or needs to be detected from far.

World cameras make use of multiple world cameras to improve accuracy and increase the FoV for detection. from far. 





-----------

### CornerRefineMethod {#enums-cornerrefinemethod}

The Aruco/April tag detector comes with several corner refinement methods. Choosing the right corner refinement method has an impact on the accuracy and speed trade-off that comes with each detection pipeline. Corner refinement only applies to Aruco and April tags, not QR codes. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| None | | No refinement, may have inaccurate corners.   |
| Subpix | | Corners have subpixel coordinates. High detection rate, very fast, reasonable accuracy.   |
| Contour | | High detection rate, fast, reasonable accuracy.   |
| AprilTag | | Reasonable detection rate, slowest, but very accurate.   |








-----------

### FPSHint {#enums-fpshint}

Used to hint to the back-end the max frames per second that should be analyzed. This is set in the MLMarkerTrackerCustomProfile structure and this setting applies to all enabled trackers. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Low | |   |
| Medium | |   |
| High | |   |
| Max | |   |




**Details**

CPU load is a combination of enabled detector types, FpsHint and ResolutionHint. More detectors with a higher FPS and resolution hints will result in a higher CPU load. High CPU load can affect the performance of your system. 





-----------

### FullAnalysisIntervalHint {#enums-fullanalysisintervalhint}

In order to improve performance, the detectors don't always run on the full frame. Full frame analysis is however necessary to detect new markers that weren't detected before. Use this option to control how often the detector may detect new markers and its impact on tracking performance. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Max | | Detector analyzes every frame fully.   |
| Fast | | Detector analyzes frame fully very often.   |
| Medium | | Detector analyzes frame fully a few times per second.   |
| Slow | | Detector analyzes frame fully about every second.   |








-----------

### MarkerType {#enums-markertype}

Represents the different marker types supported by the API 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| None | 0| Represents no marker   |
| QR | 1| QR code of Model 1 or 2   |
| Aruco_April | 2| Aruco marker and AprilTag   |
| EAN_13 | 4| EAN-13 (experimental)   |
| UPC_A | 8| UPC-A (experimental)   |
| All | 0x3FFFFFFF| All supported markers   |








-----------

### Profile {#enums-profile}

Represents the different tracker profiles used to optimize marker tracking in difference use cases. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Default | | Generic tracker profile. Tracker profile that covers standard use cases. If this does not fit the needs of the application try the other profiles listed below.   |
| Custom | | Application can define a custom tracker profiler.   |
| Speed | | Use this profile to reduce the compute load and increase detection/tracker speed. This can result poor poses.   |
| Accuracy | | Use this profile to optimize for accurate marker poses. This can cause increased load on the compute.   |
| SmallTargets | | Use this profile to optimize for markers that are small or for larger markers that need to detected from far.   |
| Large_FOV | 6| Use this profile to be able to detect markers across a larger Field Of View. Marker Tracker system will attempt to use multiple cameras to detect the markers.   |








-----------

### ResolutionHint {#enums-resolutionhint}

The ResolutionHint enum values are used to hint to the back-end the resolution that should be used. This is set in the MLMarkerTracker.CustomProfile structure and this setting currently only applies to the QR, UPC and EAN detectors. 

| Enumerator | Value | Description |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Low | |   |
| Medium | |   |
| High | |   |




**Details**

CPU load is a combination of enabled detector types, FpsHint and ResolutionHint. More detectors and a higher fps and resolution hints will result in a higher CPU load. High CPU load can affect the performance of your system.
