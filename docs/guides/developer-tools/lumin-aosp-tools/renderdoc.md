## RenderDoc Overview

[RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org/) is a stand-alone graphics debugger that allows quick and easy single-frame capture and detailed introspection of any application.

Some common use cases for RenderDoc with Magic Leap 2 are:
* Debugging a shader
* Viewing pixel history
* Viewing a specific texture

## Prerequisites
Prior to using this guide, you should have: 
* [Magic Leap Hub](https://ml2-developer.magicleap.com/downloads) installed 
* Magic Leap 2 device configured for use with your computer, either via WiFi on the bridge, or with a USB cable connecting the Magic Leap 2 device to the computer you're using for development. [Learn more](docs/guides/getting-started)
* RenderDoc (Instructions for installation follow this section, if you haven't done it yet.)

## Install RenderDoc on Magic Leap Hub
You can install RenderDoc from the Magic Leap Hub. Do the following:

1. Open Magic Leap Hub and navigate to the Package Manager. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_install.png")} >Install RenderDoc</Image>

2. Click the **All** icon. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/install_renderdoc_from_package_manager.png")} >Package Manager Screen</Image>

3. Find the RenderDoc package within the Common Packages category. Download the latest one. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_download.png")} >RenderDoc Package</Image>

4. Add the **adb** binary to your PATH Environment variable to ensure RenderDoc will be able to see the ML2 device. The binary can be found under C:\Users\_user_\MagicLeap\MLHub\plugins\com.magicleap.adb.win32.x86_64_1.0.41.28_0_2_202304071616\adb\adb.exe for Windows. Add this path to your Path environment variable on Windows. On Mac there should be something similar.

5. Check that you've added the adb binary correctly by opening a command prompt window and typing:
```adb devices```

You should see your device connected to the host.
<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_device_attached.png")} >RenderDoc Device Attached Status</Image>

6. Launch RenderDoc from the Magic Leap Hub. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_launch.png")} >RenderDoc Launch</Image>

7. The RenderDoc window opens, and you should see this: <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_tool.png")} >RenderDoc Tool</Image>

You should now have RenderDoc installed, and you can move on to taking a capture to work with in RenderDoc.

## Take a Capture with RenderDoc

This section walks you through how to take a capture with RenderDoc that you can use for analysis. 
Do the following:

1. In the Renderdoc window, clicking on Replay Context: Local in the bottom left corner will show a drop-down menu with the Magic leap 2 device as an option. It will show as (Offline) however if you click it, it will connect to the device.

Once its connected, it says **Remote Server Ready** in the bottom status bar. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_replay.png")} >RenderDoc Replay Context</Image>

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_check_server_ready.png")} >RenderDoc Check Server Ready</Image>

If you connect the device after opening Renderdoc, it may take a few seconds for it to connect.

If you wish to check the device is being detected, you can navigate to **File > Attach to Running Instance**. This opens the Remote Host Manager and you can see if the device has the server running on it allowing RenderDoc connection. 

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_magicleap_localhost.png")} >RenderDoc Remote Host Manager</Image>

2. You may now navigate to the **Launch Application** tab where you can click the |…| at the end of Executable Path and browse the device for applications you’d like to run from inside RenderDoc. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_choose_app.png")} >RenderDoc Choose Application</Image>

3. Select your application and launch it. 

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_launch_app.png")} >RenderDoc Launch Application</Image>

4. You should see the app running on your device. Within Renderdoc, a capture window should open up. Click the **Capture Frame(s) Immediately** button. 

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_capture_frame.png")} >RenderDoc Capture Frame</Image>

5. A progress bar will appear when the capture starts. Wait for the capture to complete. 

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_capture_progressbar.png")} >RenderDoc Capture Progress Bar</Image>

6. Save the capture by right clicking it insidethe Captures Collection section 

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_captures_collected.png")} >RenderDoc Capture Collected</Image>

7. Open the capture by closing the application inside the Magic Leap 2 or opening the fileon your computer.

<Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/renderdoc_open_capture.png")} >RenderDoc Open Capture</Image>

You now know how to create and view a capture with RenderDoc. 

## How to Analyze Your RenderDoc Capture

There are a number of resources you can use to learn how to analyze your RenderDoc capture. They're all created by RenderDoc and provided here for convenience. Resources to review include:

* [How Do I?](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/index.html#) - A RenderDoc page that lists commonly asked questions and provides tutorials for each. 
* [How to debug a shader](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_debug_shader.html)
* [How to inspect a pixel value](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_inspect_pixel.html)
* [How to view a specific texture](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_view_texture.html)
* [How to edit a shader](https://renderdoc.org/docs/how/how_edit_shader.html)

Additionally, we offer Magic Leap-specific tutorials about: 
* Debug a shader
* View pixel history
* View a specific texture

These follow in the next sections. Instructions for each assume you completed RenderDoc installation and collected a capture. 

## Debug a Shader
Shader debugging in RenderDoc allows you to step-by-step run through a shader at a given time in the frame and make sure the right shader is being used at the right time. 

1. Make sure RenderDoc is open and connected to Magic Leap 2. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_replay_context.png")} >RenderDoc Open and Connected to Magic Leap 2</Image>

2. Click on **File > Open Capture** at the top. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_open_file_capture.png")} >RenderDoc File Open Capture</Image>

3. Select a capture from the list of displayed captures and open it by double clicking on it. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_choose_capture.png")} >RenderDoc Choose Capture</Image>

4. When you open a capture, it should show a view similar to this one: <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_view_capture.png")} >RenderDoc View Capture</Image>

5. Click on a draw call AND select a pixel with right click. You can then debug the pixel from the Pixel Context window. Click the **Debug** button. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_debug_shader.png")} >RenderDoc Debug Shader</Image>

6. A Disassembly window should open up the associated shader which can be stepped through for debugging. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_disassembly_window.png")} >RenderDoc Debug Shader</Image>

You can do this to debug any shader as needed.

## View Pixel History
Viewing pixel history is useful when you are debugging a specific part of the frame, for instance a corruption like an incorrect color showing up as part of a final image. Pixel history helps you understand which operations influenced the specific area you are viewing and you can step through each operation to see its state at a given moment. 

1. Make sure RenderDoc is open and connected to Magic Leap 2. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_replay_context.png")} >RenderDoc Open and Connected to Magic Leap 2</Image>

2. Click on **File > Open Capture** at the top. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_open_file_capture.png")} >RenderDoc File Open Capture</Image>

3. Select a capture from the list of displayed captures and open it by double clicking on it. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_choose_capture.png")} >RenderDoc Choose Capture</Image>

4. When you open a capture, it should show a view similar to this one: <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_view_capture.png")} >RenderDoc View Capture</Image>

5. Hover over the texture in the viewer on left to show pixel information below the texture. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_pixel_info.png")} >RenderDoc Pixel Info</Image>

6. Right-click on the mouse to pick the pixel for analysis. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_examine_pixel.png")} >RenderDoc Pixel Analysis</Image>

7. In the Pixel Context Display, you can click **History** to view the pixel history view. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_pixel_history.png")} >RenderDoc Pixel History</Image>

8. In the Pixel History view, you can view every modification made to the selected pixel from the start of the frame to the currently selected event. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_pixel_history_panel.png")} >RenderDoc Pixel History Panel</Image>

9. Double click an event to jump the replay to that event. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_doubleclick_replay_event.png")} >RenderDoc Replay an Event</Image>

10. View the state of the pixel at the replay point and verify its behavior. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_view_pixel_state.png")} >RenderDoc View and Verify Pixel State</Image> 

You're able to use this guide to take a look at pixels in any captures you like.

## View a Specific Texture 

Viewing a specific pixel texture can help you ensure the texture states (onscreen and offscreen) at that point in the frame are correct. You can verify texture format, size and contents this way.

1. Make sure RenderDoc is open and connected to Magic Leap 2. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_replay_context.png")} >RenderDoc Open and Connected to Magic Leap 2</Image>

2. Click on **File > Open Capture** at the top. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_open_file_capture.png")} >RenderDoc File Open Capture</Image>

3. Select a capture from the list of displayed captures and open it by double clicking on it. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_choose_capture.png")} >RenderDoc Choose Capture</Image>

4. When you open a capture, it should show a view similar to this one: <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_view_capture.png")} >RenderDoc View Capture</Image>

5. After you open a capture, in the Texture Viewer, click the **Open Texture List** button. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_open_texture_list.png")} >RenderDoc Open Texture List</Image>

6. Click on a texture name to open its resource details. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_texture_resource_details.png")} >RenderDoc Click Texture Name</Image>

7. In the texture resource details, you can view the initialization parameters, usage in frame, and related resources. <Image url= {require("/img/renderdoc/rd_initialization_parameters.png")} >RenderDoc Texture Resource Details</Image>

You can view any pixel texture in your capture with these instructions.

## Known Issues that Can Affect a RenderDoc Capture

The following are known issues when taking a RenderDoc capture:

* For memory heavy applications, the Magic Leap 2 device has issues taking Renderdoc captures. You can workaround this issue by closing background apps to free up some memory.
* For GPU heavy applications, Renderdoc captures can cause the GPU to freeze. This happens as Renderdoc also adds to the load while capturing. If encountered, the device will need to be rebooted.
