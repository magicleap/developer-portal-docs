:::info
Application Simulator is backwards compatible with all versions of the MLSDK starting with 1.0.0. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest Application Simulator updates in Package Manager.
:::

Application Simulator's support for API features varies. Features are supported in Simulator, Device, and Hybrid modes. Some are not supported at all.

## Application Simulator Key API Info

:::caution
If an API feature does not work and is not on this list, it is not supported by Application Simulator. Unsupported API features compile and link for host targets, but return `MLResult_NotImplemented` when requested.
:::

In the Hybrid mode column, the standalone references to Simulator, Device, and Mixed (i.e both Simulator and Device) indicate the **data source** for APIs. Graphics and Audio APIs work differently, which is expanded on in the relevant cells.
