## Uninstalling the Lab 2.0

With the arrival of [the Magic Leap Hub](/docs/guides/developer-tools/ml-hub/magic-leap-hub.md), it's time to remove the now-deprecated "Lab 2.0" software. Because the name of the binary executable files have changed, it is not possible to do a smooth "upgrade" to the new software. This will therefore require a [fresh installation](/docs/guides/getting-started/install-the-tools.md#install-magic-leap-hub) of the Magic Leap Hub.

Follow the instructions below to successfully uninstall the Lab 2.0:

<Tabs groupId="device-flashing-instructions">

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

1. Right-click the Lab 2.0, located on the Windows taskbar, or on the desktop.

2. Select **Properties** from the drop-down list. (If on the taskbar, you'll need to right-click again to find **Properties**).

3. In the **Properties** window, press the **Open File Location** button to get to the root folder where the Lab 2.0 is installed.

4. From this folder, find the **uninstall.exe** application file and run it. This should guide you through the rest of the process of uninstalling the Lab 2.0.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Next, make sure you install the [Magic Leap Hub](/docs/guides/getting-started/install-the-tools.md#install-magic-leap-hub), if you have not done so, already.
