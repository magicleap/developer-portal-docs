[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) is a Free and Open Source cross-platform-capable game engine that can be used to develop on the Magic Leap 2. Additionally, as Godot implements the OpenXR specification and is currently independent of Magic Leap-specific SDKs, development of an application can be done on Windows, MacOS, or even Linux.

The following guides are all based on Godot `4.0.x`.
