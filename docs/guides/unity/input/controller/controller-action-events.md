This section demonstrates how to use Unity's Input System to access input events from the Magic Leap 2 controller.

Input actions contain using 3 callbacks, **started**, **performed**, and **canceled**. While the order and how the events are triggered depend on the type of the action, the table below shows the default behavior.

|Type|Description|
|-----|-------|
|InputAction.started | When a control is actuated (i.e. moving away from its resting position)|
|InputAction.performed | Called right after started, and continues to be called while the action is being performed.|
| InputAction.canceled | When the control moves back to its default value (i.e. resting position)|

## Controller Example - Input Action Events

The example script below subscribes to the Magic Leap controller's input events, and debugs the input values to the Debug Log.

```csharp showLineNumbers
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.InputSystem;

public class ExampleClass : MonoBehaviour
{
    // This is was autogenerated and allows developers to create a dynamic
    // instance of an InputActionAsset which includes predefined action maps
    // that correspond to all of the Magic Leap 2's input.
    private MagicLeapInputs _magicLeapInputs;
    
    // This class is an Action Map and was autogenerated by the Unity Input
    // System and includes predefined bindings for the Magic Leap 2 Controller
    // Input Events.
    private MagicLeapInputs.ControllerActions _controllerActions;

    void Start()
    {
        // Initialize the InputActionAsset
        _magicLeapInputs = new MagicLeapInputs();
        _magicLeapInputs.Enable();

        //Initialize the ControllerActions using the Magic Leap Input
        _controllerActions = new MagicLeapInputs.ControllerActions(_magicLeapInputs);

        //Subscribe to your choice of the controller events
        _controllerActions.IsTracked.performed += IsTrackedOnPerformed;
        _controllerActions.Trigger.performed += HandleOnTrigger;
        _controllerActions.Bumper.performed += HandleOnBumper;
    }

    // Handles the event to determine if the controller is tracking.
    private void IsTrackedOnPerformed(InputAction.CallbackContext obj)
    {
        Debug.Log("The Controller Is tracking");
    }

    // Handles the event for the Trigger.
    private void HandleOnTrigger(InputAction.CallbackContext obj)
    {
        float triggerValue = obj.ReadValue<float>();
        Debug.Log("The Trigger value is : " +  triggerValue);
    }

    // Handles the event for the Bumper.
    private void HandleOnBumper(InputAction.CallbackContext obj)
    {
        bool bumperDown = obj.ReadValueAsButton();
        Debug.Log("The Bumper is pressed down " + bumperDown);
        Debug.Log("The Bumper was released this frame: " + obj.action.WasReleasedThisFrame());
    }

    // Handles the disposing all of the input events.
    void OnDestroy()
    {
        _controllerActions.IsTracked.performed -= IsTrackedOnPerformed;
        _controllerActions.Trigger.performed -= HandleOnTrigger;
        _controllerActions.Bumper.performed -= HandleOnBumper;
        _magicLeapInputs.Dispose();
    }
}
```
