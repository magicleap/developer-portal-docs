## Namespace

The MLVoice API is defined under the `UnityEngine.XR.MagicLeap` namespace.

``` csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.XR.MagicLeap;
```

## Components

- `MLVoice.VoiceEnabled`
  - A boolean to indicate if the system supports Voice Intents.
- `MLVoice.SetupVoiceIntents(MLVoiceIntentsConfiguration voiceConfiguration)`
  - Returns an MLResult. Configures Settings sent, Sets the callbacks for voice intent events, and starts processing.
- `MLVoice.OnVoiceEvent`
  - An event to subscribe to that triggers when a Voice Intents event happens. Will give a Boolean to indicate if the event was successful and a MLVoice.IntentEvent.
- `MLVoice.Stop`
  - Stop unsets callbacks and stops processing.
  - This is optional, it is not necessary for shutdown. This is only needed if a user wants to stop processing at runtime after call MLVoice.SetupVoiceIntents. MLVoice can be restarted by calling MLVoice.SetupVoiceIntents.
  - Currently used in the example as a workaround for the issue with system notifications stopping Voice Processing to stop and restart Voice Processing.

## API Structures, Events, and Enums

``` csharp
/// <summary>
/// Voice state in voice event.
/// </summary>
public enum State
{
    /// <summary>
    ///  Intent hotword detected, Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) session is going to start.
    /// </summary>
    HotwordDetected,

### Setting up Voice Intents Configuration

To add Voice Intents to your scene, you must use an asset called "Voice Intents Configuration" located under `Assets/Create/MagicLeap`:

![Voice Intents configuration asset](/img/unity/input/voice-intents/voice-intents-configuration-asset.png)

### Asset Configuration Data

- Id
  - Must be a Unique integer.
- Value
  - This is the voice command that will be spoken. There are no limitations on the length of this phrase currently. It should be specific enough to accomplish what is needed, but it is recommended that it is not so long that it is cumbersome to say.
  - The value may contain an or operator, " | ", to indicate multiple phrases that will trigger the same event. For example, in the image below, both `Hello Friend | Hello Buddy` phrases will trigger unity_test_3.
