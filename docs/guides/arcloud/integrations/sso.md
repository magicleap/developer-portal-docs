## Overview

The Keycloak instance bundled with an AR Cloud installation allows [integrating an external Identity Provider][idp] to
support [Single Sign-On][sso-protocols] for its users. This page contains short instructions of the configurations steps
needed to prepare such an integration. For details, please refer to the [Keycloak documentation][idp].

## SAML 2.0

SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal
(usually an end user) between a SAML authority, named an **Identity Provider**, and a SAML consumer, named a **Service
Provider**. Keycloak, in our scenario, acts as the latter.

Different identity solutions might have slightly different names for the fields that need to be copied from Keycloak. In
general the process requires to create an application / connection in the identity solution and link it with Keycloak
using the following fields:

* the **Redirect URI** / **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** / **Application Callback URL** / **Single Sign On
    URL** - used to send a HTTP POST request with the `SAMLResponse` after a successful user login using the Identity
    Provider
* the **Service Provider entity ID** / **SP entity ID** / **Audience URI** / **Audience Restriction** - restricts the
    audience to the specified Service Provider configuration (one Service Provider might have multiple Identity
    Providers configured)
* the **SAML entity descriptor** / **Metadata URL** / **SAML Metadata URL** / **Identity Provider Metadata** - a link to
    an XML document with all the information necessary to configure the Identity Provider, e.g. entity ID, signing
    certificate, URLs of the endpoints, supported attributes

### Configuration

To configure a [SAML-based identity provider][saml], follow the steps below:

1. Use the configured domain with an `/auth/` path or click on **Users** in the top menu of the Enterprise Console.
1. Log in using the generated credentials for the administrator account. The credentials are provided after a successful
   installation.
1. Select the `magicleap` realm from the top-left corner.
1. Click on **Identity providers** in the left menu.
1. Select **SAML v2.0** from the list of supported providers.
1. Enter an **Alias** for your Identity Provider. Changing this value causes the **Redirect URI** to change, which requires an
   update in the configuration of the identity solution.

Detailed instructions can be found in the Okta documentation:

[Create SAML app integrations][okta-saml]
:::

7. Open the admin panel for your Okta instance.
1. Expand **Applications** in the left menu and click on **Applications**.
1. Click on the **Create App Integration** button.
1. Select **SAML 2.0** as the **Sign-in method** and click on **Next**.
1. Enter an **App name** and click on **Next**.
1. Copy the **Redirect URI** value from Kecyloak and paste it in Okta as **Single sign-on URL**. The value should be in
   the following format:

   ```
   https://{your-domain}/auth/realms/magicleap/broker/{your-alias}/endpoint`
   ```

1. Copy the **Service provider entity ID** value from Keycloak and paste it in Okta as **Audience URI**.
1. Complete the form with your custom configuration, if needed, and click on **Next**.
1. Select **I'm a software vendor. I'd like to integrate my app with Okta** and click on **Finish**.
1. Copy the generated **Metadata URL** for the application in Okta and paste it in Keycloak as **SAML entity
   descriptor**.
1. After a successful verification of the metadata, the Okta application can be added in Keycloak by clicking on
   **Add**.
1. [Assign the users][okta-assign] you want to have access to Keycloak using the created application in Okta.

Detailed instructions can be found in the Auth0 documentation:

[Configure Auth0 as SAML Identity Provider][auth0-saml]
:::

7. Open the admin panel for your Auth0 instance.
1. Expand **Applications** in the left menu and click on **Applications**.
1. Click on the **Create Application** button.
1. Enter a **Name**, select **Regular Web Applications** and click on **Create**.
1. Click on the **Settings** tab, scroll down and expand **Advanced Settings**, click on the **Endpoints** tab and copy
   the **SAML Metadata URL** value from the **SAML** section.
1. Paste the copied URL in Keycloak as **SAML entity descriptor**.
1. After a successful verification of the metadata, the Auth0 application can be added in Keycloak by clicking on
   **Add**.
1. Click on the **Addons** tab for your application in Auth0, click on **SAML2 WEB APP** and then on the **Settings**
   tab in the popup window.
1. Copy the **Redirect URI** value from Kecyloak and paste it in Auth0 as **Application Callback URL**.
1. Copy the **Service provider entity ID** value from Keycloak and paste it in Auth0 under **Settings** in the following
   format:

   ```json
   {
     "audience": "https://{your-domain}/auth/realms/magicleap"
   }
   ```

1. Click on **Enable** to save the configuration.

### Verification

1. Log out of the Enteprise Console, try logging in again and pick the alias you configured to be redirected to your
   Identity Provider.
1. Use the credentials for one of the users from the Identity Provider.
1. Fill in the required user data in Keycloak to complete the process (this is required if the user does not yet exist
   in Keycloak and needs to be done only once).
