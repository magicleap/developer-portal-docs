Beginning in OS release *placeholder*, third party developers with a [Developer Pro or Enterprise Magic Leap 2 license](https://www.magicleap.care/hc/en-us/articles/9356966949389-Managing-Your-Magic-Leap-2-License#:~:text=License%20Types&text=Customers%20purchasing%20a%20Developer%20Pro,license%20key%20through%20their%20reseller.) now have access to request iris data and enable iris unlock inside within their applications. Iris Unlock is a feature that enables iris recognition as a biometric authentication method on the Magic Leap 2 device. This feature can be used as an alternative to requesting a pin or password, and can be used for things such as:

- Requesting authentication from a user within your app
- Encrypting or decrypting sensitive data using a key that depends on biometric authentication
