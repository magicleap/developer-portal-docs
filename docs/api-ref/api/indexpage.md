# Magic Leap Native SDK (C API)

The Magic Leap Native SDK exposes interfaces to our services and platform features so that you can integrate them with your 3D engine or application. This SDK is intended for use with the Magic Leap 2 hardware.

Please see the [Native Development Guides](https://developer-docs.magicleap.cloud/docs/category/native) for more details on how to use the SDK.


:::note

Experimental APIs (APIs marked with the `\experimental` docs tag) does not guarantee backwards compatibility and the feature can be completely removed in a future release without any alternate APIs to replace their functionality. So, please use these experimental APIs with caution. The goal of these experimental APIs is to collect developer feedback. Once the API reaches a steady state and is ready for production use cases the `\experimental` tag will be removed.
