## Magic Leap OS - May 2023 - B3E.230330.11-R.043

**Donâ€™t forget:** Some Magic Leap hardware and software features are in a pre-release state and might not be available, might contain bugs or defects, and might experience delays or failures. Read this document for guidance on the current state of Magic Leap hardware and software. This guidance helps developers make the best possible use of the Magic Leap platform.

## Flashing Instructions

Before flashing make sure to power cycle your device without the cable plugged in. Hold down the power button for 20 seconds to do so. 

When flashing, you **MUST** flash in a linear sequence based on the build order in the table below. For example, if you're on B3E.220619.07-R.107_user (build order #4), you MUST flash B3E.220619.07-R.124_user (build order #5) then B3E.220721.07-R.026_user (build order #6) for your device to work properly with that OS.

| Build Order | Build Fingerprint        |
| ----------- | ------------------------ |
| 15          | B3E.230427.10-R.023      |

| 8           | B3E.220818.12-R.085_user |
| 7           | B3E.220721.07-R.027_user |
| 6           | B3E.220721.07-R.026_user |

| 4           | B3E.220619.07-R.107_user |

We recommend you to use ML Hub flashing capability to flash the OS. Contact your Magic Leap customer care representative for any additional support with regards to flashing your device.

## Known Issues

- Upgrade will reset time to current time if the time was changed prior to upgrade.
- Control LED may not blink during a firmware update.
- Empty buffer at the beginning of Android Audio capture adds marginal latency.  No workaround, resolved for following release.
- Only the left or right display turns on after waking from Doze on rare occasions. Workaround by entering/exiting Doze again.
- When a user utilizes more graphics memory (by opening applications, running capture, etc) visual corruption of virtual content can be seen. The recommendation would be for users to make sure only the necessary app they are currently using is open. App developers should be careful to only use the memory necessary, and heavy usage of graphics memory in a single app may still cause this issue.
- Web RTC session disconnects after returning from Standby power state.  Workaround is when using an application that includes Web RTC functionality, disable the Standby power state in Settings before launch.
- Multi-user:
  - Any currently logged in secondary user and guest user are not able to delete a user IF active (causes reboot)
  - If the Guest user creates a PIN and starts a new session, the devices will reboot
  - Administrator setting controls the secondary user and guest settings for the following: doze, hand tracking.
